# Business Analyst Portfolio - AI-Assisted Design Project

## Overview
This repository contains the comprehensive design documentation for my Business Analyst Portfolio website, created using AI-assisted tools to demonstrate modern development workflows. The project showcases how AI can bridge the gap between business requirements and technical implementation.

## Purpose
The design document in this repository demonstrates an AI-assisted workflow using Visual Studio Code Insider with GitHub Copilot. It illustrates:
- AI-powered generation of technical specifications
- Iterative refinement based on simulated engineering feedback
- Collaborative design process between business and technical roles

## Navigation Guide

### Accessing the Design Document
1. **Navigate to the `doc/` folder** in this repository
2. **Open `design_document.md`** to view the comprehensive design specification
3. The document is in Markdown format and renders beautifully on GitHub

### Understanding the AI-Assisted Process
The design document includes special markers showing:
- **AI-Generated Content**: Sections initially created by GitHub Copilot
- **Engineering Questions**: Technical uncertainties identified with AI assistance
- **Simulated Feedback**: Realistic engineering team responses
- **Iterative Refinement**: How the design evolved through multiple versions

### Supporting Files
- All design documentation is contained in the `doc/` folder
- The main application code is in the root directory
- Configuration files support the development environment

## Project Context
This design supports a Business Analyst Portfolio website built with:
- **Frontend**: Next.js with React
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Hosting**: Vercel platform
- **Features**: Adaptive personalization, contact forms, project showcase

## AI Tools Used
